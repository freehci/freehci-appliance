In this example, connection recovery is handled by defining an `onclose` handler for the WebSocket connection. When the connection is closed, it will try to reconnect every five seconds using `setInterval`.

If the connection is re-established, the `onopen` handler will be triggered, and the connection recovery interval will be stopped using `clearInterval`. Once the connection is re-established, the `fetchItems` method will be called to fetch the latest items from the server.

Error handling is also implemented through the `onerror` handler for the WebSocket connection. If an error occurs, it will be logged to the console. In addition, when sending a message with the `sendMessage` method, the code checks if the WebSocket connection is open before sending the message. If the connection is not open, an error message is logged.

When the Vue component is destroyed (e.g., when the user navigates away from the page), the `beforeDestroy` lifecycle method will be called. This method closes the WebSocket connection and stops any connection recovery intervals.

With this example, you can easily customize and extend the functionality to accommodate your specific needs. Remember to adapt the WebSocket URL and message types to your specific API requirements.
